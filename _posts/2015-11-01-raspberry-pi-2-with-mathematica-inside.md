A few days ago, I ordered a raspberry pi 2 ultimate starter kit set
from amazon. This Sat. it was delivered to me and I immediately start 
to make it as a small computer for my usage.

You can see from the following picture, the little black box right of 
my keyboard is the Raspberry PI 2 computer.

The assembly process is quite easy, since I just plan to do basic things at 
the beginning. So the process is just to plugin in the 8GB sd card to the slot, 
put the motherboard in the box properly, and all is done. It is now a little
cute computer.

Then we can just plug in keyboard, mouse, wifi module(which is include in the 
set), HDMI video cabel. The Raspberry PI will start when power on. At first, 
we need to install the OS like following:

After installation, it will reboot to start. The first time will require you to 
do some configuration like configure locale, login options(GUI or terminal) etc.
You can do whatever configuration for your tastes. After that, we can login to 
the system. 

The main reason I bought this is that it included a pilot version of Mathematica
with Raspberry PI in it. As a big fan of Mathematica, it is amazingly cheep to 
buy a device under $90 which contains a Mathematica(For comparison, the home
edition of Mathematica I bought cost me $295). 

So let us see the Raspberry PI 2 with Mathematica. :)

## Conclusion

I think Raspberry PI 2 is an excellent device for youth to explore the field 
of programming, which is also the target of Raspberry PI 2. The containing of 
Mathematica make it excellent quality and reasonable price device since I think
Mathematica will teach you a lot of things other language can not. (Like higher
order programming, functional programming, pattern matching etc, which are 
normally ignored in traditional programming education). 

But since its cpu is based on the ARM architecture, and the performance of the 
cpu and memory is quite low, some program will not work properly on it. So I 
think it will not work as a fully functional computer for programmer like me. 
But it is still very valueable since it contains Mathemaitca, python 
programming languages and a lot of working example of game in it.
