excerpt: There are a lot of emergence phenomena in our everyday's life. All 
         the amazing things are sometimes beyond our scope of congnition. 
         I always doubt in some sense, the God is perhaps a complexity system 
         specialist, since we can find so many clues in our daily life.

Look at the shcoking beautiful snow fakes images as bellow, are you amazed by
how can the nature produce such things?

Or maybe look at amazing plants as follow, can you think how God produce
this from scratch?

But the answer may be simpler than you think. Because all these are some form
of complexity system.


# Complexity system in a netshell

First of all, the complexity here is not the same as algorithm complexity in 
computer science. It normally accompanies with some form of
[*emergence phenomena*][1].

If we pay attention our life, we can find a lot of *emergence phenomena* around
us. Like the [flocking behaviour of birds][2], [schooling of fish][3] etc. 
Consider the following periodic table as an example, have you ever wonder 
why there are so many materials with only very few basic elements? 

![Periodic table]({{site.url}}/assets/images/Periodic_table.svg)

Further,think about the carbon-based molecules like [graphite][4] and 
[diamond][5], with the same basic element, only with a different structure, 
the diamond is one of the hardest materials on the earth while the graphite 
is one of the softest one.

Many scientists have done a lot of research of such things, and showed that 
*emergence* can be actually achieved by leting the individuals follow very 
simple rules. So in simple terms, *emergence phenomena* means the whole is 
**not only the simple summation** of every individuals.

# Behaviours of complexity system

Complexity system normally have several kind of behaviour in common. Here are
just four normally observed behaviours in complexity system.

+ *Self-organization* : Ants, birds, fireflies etc are some famous example of
this kind of behaviour. The system as a whole can show unbelievable intelligence
with every individuals follow **very very simple rules**.
+ *Chaotic behaviour* : Means the system is initial conditions sensentive. 
The most popular term is [butterfly effect][6].
+ *Fat-tailed behaviour* : Stock market bubbles and crashes as an example, 
we assume the [market is efficient][7], but actually, the market's fluctations
seldom fit the beautiful bell-curve normal distribution. I will write a 
seperate post about this topic in the future.
+ *Adaptive interaction* : Agents in the system modify their strategies in 
diverse way.


We will not explain every behaviour here in details, since it will be out of 
the scope of this article. But just to give some high level ideas of complexity
system.

# Why are they choosed?

Take [fractals][8] as an example, consider the [Koch Curve][9] for partitular,
we can make induction of the length of the curve as the following formula:

$$ L_n = \frac{4}{3} * L_{n - 1} = (\frac{4}{3})^{n - 1} * L_1 $$

So we can make induction to show that as n tends to infinity, the length of 
the curve aslo tends to infinity, although all the curve is in a bounded area.
This is a extremely efficient way to organize complexity structure to make use
of the space. Hence we can find enormously example of self similar or fractal
structure in our daily life, coach line, surface of mountain, tree branch, 
broccoli, lung lobe and more and more, you name it.

All these observation inspire me to look at problems in a new perspective. 
Just think about human neuros, they may be also follow the principle of 
*emergence*, every neuro play with  very simple rules, but hundreds billion
of neuros can produce extremely phenomena which we still can not understand.

Some other clues which indicate that human brain actually does not work in 
an [artificial neural network][10] style include that human brain is very energy
saving, although brain is actually the most expensive organ in our body, it 
only cost about 400-500 calories. For comparison, [Google Brain][11] project, 
which is said to mimic the brain of human, but actually can only do very basic 
things of human like image classification, use 16,000 computers, and consume 
about 600KW. Can you image an brain cost so much? If every brain cost so much 
power, [emission reduction][12] should just be a joke, since everyone will cost 
much much more power than a car :).


# Conclusion

I am always amazed by how clever and ingenious God create the world. He must be
a extremely good complexity system expertise.

We have a long way to go on the way to the achievement of artificial 
intelligence. It is a hard way, which need the combination of a lot of different
disciplines like biology, phyics, math, complexity system, computer science and
even philosophy. I don't believe just to make machine learning more and more 
accurate itself is enough to lead us through this difficult path.
