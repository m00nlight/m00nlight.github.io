excerpt: There are a lot of emergence phenomena in our everyday's life. All 
         the amazing things are sometimes beyond our scope of congnition. 
         I always doubt in some sense, the God maybe a complexity system 
         specialist, since we can find so many clues in our daily life.

Look at the shcoking beautiful snow fakes image as bellow, are you amazed by
how can the nature produce such things?

Or maybe look at amazing plants as follow, can you think how God produce
this from scratch?

But the answer may be simpler than you think. Because all these are some form
of complexity system.


# Complexity system in a netshell

First of all, the complexity here is not the same as algorithm complexity in 
computer science. It normally accompanies with some form of
[*emergence phenomena*][1].

If we pay attention our life, we can find a lot of *emergence phenomena* around
us. Like the [flocking behaviour of birds][2], [schooling of fish][3] etc. 
Consider the following periodic table as an example, have you ever wonder 
why there are so many materials with only very few basic elements?

Further,think about the carbon-based molecules like [graphite][4] and 
[diamond][5], with the same basic element, only with a different structure, 
the diamond is one of the most hard materials on the earth while the graphite 
is one of the soft one.

Many scientists have done a lot of research of such things, and showed that 
*emergence* can be actually achieved by leting the individuals follow very 
simple rules. So in simple terms, *emergence phenomena* means the whole is 
not only the simple summation of every individuals.

# Behaviours of complexity system

Complexity system normally have several kind of behaviour in common. Here are
just four normally observed behaviour in complexity system.

1. *Self-organization* : Ants, birds, fireflies etc are some famous example of
this kind of behaviour. The system as a whole can show unbelievable intelligence
with every individuals follow **very very simple rules**.
2. *Chaotic behaviour* : Maybe the most famous one is [butterfly effect][6].
3. *Fat-tailed behaviour* : Stock market bubbles and crashes as an example, 
we assume the [market is efficient][7], but actually, the market's fluctations
seldom fit the beautiful bell-curve normal distribution.
4. *Adaptive interaction* : Agents in the system modify their strategies in 
diverse way.
